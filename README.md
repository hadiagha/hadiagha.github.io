# Personal Blog of Hadi Aghazadeh

This repository contains the source code for my personal blog: a space where I write about
**reinforcement learning for business**, **machine learning engineering**, and **data-driven
decision-making**.

I am a Databricks Certified Machine Learning Engineer and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Calgary,
working at the intersection of reinforcement learning, operations research, and ML systems. On this blog
I share:

- Practical applications of RL and optimization to real-world problems (pricing, logistics, operations)
- Notes and lessons learned from building production ML systems
- Tutorials and teaching material related to my book *Reinforcement Learning for Business* and courses
