## About Me

I am **Hadi Aghazadeh**, a Databricks Certified Machine Learning Engineer and Ph.D. candidate at the **University of Calgary** (GPA: 4.0/4.0). My work sits at the intersection of **reinforcement learning**, **operations research**, and **machine learning systems** for real-world business problems.

I am the author of the upcoming Manning book **"Reinforcement Learning for Business"**, where I focus on making RL practical for pricing, logistics, and operations at scale.

Currently, I work as a **Machine Learning Engineer at Bits in Glass**, building production-grade ML solutions on **Databricks (Mosaic AI, MLflow)** and cloud platforms.

### Research & Applied Interests

My main interests include:

- **Reinforcement learning for operations and pricing** (e.g., dynamic surge pricing, fuel pricing, vehicle routing)
- **Demand forecasting and time series** at scale
- **Optimization and decision-making** (linear programming, RL-based control)
- **LLM-powered systems** (RAG, document understanding, agentic workflows)

My Ph.D. research focuses on **reinforcement learning for vehicle routing**, bridging academic ideas with deployable systems in industry.

### Industry Experience

Over the past years, I have worked across startups and industry on data-intensive products:

- **Machine Learning Engineer – Bits in Glass (2024–Present)**  
  Building ML and LLM systems on Databricks, including invoice automation and dynamic fuel pricing optimization.
- **Machine Learning Developer – AltaML (2023)**  
  Contributed to a hybrid fuel demand forecasting model deployed to 100+ sites, driving significant annual savings.
- **Senior Data Scientist – Snapp (2021–2022)**  
  Led RL-based **dynamic surge pricing** improving order fulfillment by ~5% (~200K+ orders/day) and **fraud detection** solutions reducing manual review time by 300 hours/month.
- **Data Scientist – Fanap (PARSA) (2018–2021)**  
  Developed ATM cash demand forecasting and optimization systems, reducing operational costs by ~10%.

### Education

- **Ph.D. Candidate, University of Calgary** – Geomatics Engineering  
  *July 2022 – Expected Oct 2025*  
  Research: **Reinforcement Learning for Vehicle Routing**
- **M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering**, Amirkabir University of Technology (2015–2018)
- **B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering**, Iran University of Science and Technology (2011–2015)

### Teaching & Learning

I enjoy teaching and translating complex ideas into practical workflows. I have:

- Created **Udemy courses** on:
  - *Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit Problems in Python*
  - *Reinforcement Learning for Operations Research*
- Served as **Teaching Assistant** for *Data Mining and Databases* at the University of Calgary.

### Honors & Scholarships (Selected)
